# Tictactoe
A Tic Tac Toe game you can play in your browser!

From https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe

This app will use module and factory patterns to organise code. The game will render a 3x3 gameboard, and use DOM manipulation and event listeners to determine when the user has selected a square. 

A function to determine whether the game is over checkes for two scenarios:
- three in a row
- a tie

The GUI contains functionality for users to input their names, a start/restart game button and a "Congratulations!" display element.
